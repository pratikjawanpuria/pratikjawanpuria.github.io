I am a researcher at Amazon. I belong to the <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/team/core-machine-learning">Core Machine Learning</a> team. My research interests lie in the areas of machine learning and optimization. I am based in Bengaluru, India.

I completed my B.Tech in <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/">computer science</a> from <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a> in 2009. After a brief stint as a software engineer at Cisco, I returned to IIT Bombay as a grad student. I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~saketh/">Prof. J. Saketha Nath</a>. I then worked as a postdoctoral researcher with <a href="http://www.ml.uni-saarland.de/people/hein.htm">Prof. Matthias Hein</a> at <a href="http://www.cs.uni-saarland.de/">Saarland University</a>.

    My research interest primarily lies in machine learning and optimization. My doctoral work was focused on developing kernel learning frameworks for learning several problems jointly (a.k.a. multi-task learning). Key ideas include mixed-norm regularizations, saddle-point optimization approaches, and path-following algorithms. An interesting application I worked on was Rule Learning. We modeled this problem as a kernel learning problem. Below are some specific themes I have been working on recently.

  <h4>Product based research at Amazon </h4>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li> <b>Identifying product safety concerns</b>: We develop algorithms that identify quality defects in products sold at Amazon's platform. The quality defects of interest to me are those that may result in safety concern. </li>
    <li> <b> Identify consumable products</b>: The other problem I am working on is to identify products that are consumables.
  </ul>
  <h4>Current research projects</h4>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li> <b>Low-rank optimization with structure</b>: We proposed the first generic framework for learning low-rank matrices with structural constraints for large scale applications. We exploit a variational characterization of the nuclear norm regularization. Our key technical contribution is a saddle point approach for solving such problems, where the low-rank and structural constraints are equivalently decoupled onto two separate factors. This makes our approach simpler and scalable. The proposed algorithms are developed in Riemannian optimization setting. Empirically, we showed results in four different applications: a) matrix completion, b) robust matrix completion, c) Hankel matrix learning, and d) multi-task feature learning. [<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07352">arXiv:1704.07352</a>].</li>
    <li> <b>Sparse positive semi-definite matrices</b>: Learning a sparse positive semi-definite matrix is an important problem in multi-task learning, among other settings. We propose to learn this sparse positive semi-definite matrix efficiently without enforcing the positive semi-definite constraint on the matrix. This makes our solution more amenable to big data settings. Our analysis ensures that we are guaranteed to learn a positive semi-definite output kernel. The algorithm was developed in the stochastic dual-coordinate ascent framework. This work was accepted in <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5898-efficient-output-kernel-learning-for-multiple-tasks">NIPS 2015</a>.</li>
