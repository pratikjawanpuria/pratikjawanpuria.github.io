I am a researcher at Amazon. I belong to the <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/team/core-machine-learning">Core Machine Learning</a> team. My research interests lie in the areas of machine learning and optimization. I am based in Bengaluru, India.

I completed my B.Tech in <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/">computer science</a> from <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a> in 2009. After a brief stint as a software engineer at Cisco, I returned to IIT Bombay as a grad student. I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~saketh/">Prof. J. Saketha Nath</a>. I then worked as a postdoctoral researcher with <a href="http://www.ml.uni-saarland.de/people/hein.htm">Prof. Matthias Hein</a> at <a href="http://www.cs.uni-saarland.de/">Saarland University</a>.

My doctoral work was focused on developing kernel learning frameworks for learning several problems jointly. Key ideas include mixed-norm regularizations, saddle-point convex optimization approaches and path-following algorithms. An interesting application I worked on was Rule Learning. We modeled this problem as a kernel learning problem.

  During post-doctoral research, I developed a projection-free convex approach for learning sparse positive semi-definite matrices. The proposed algorithm learned output kernel for multi-task learning problems very efficiently. It was implemented in the stochastic dual-coordinate ascent framework.

  My research at Amazon is been on developing algorithms that identify quality defects in products sold at Amazon's platform. The quality defects of interest to me are those that may result in safety concern. The other problem I am working on is to identify products that are consumables.
