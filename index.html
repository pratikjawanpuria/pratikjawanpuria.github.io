I am a researcher at Amazon. I belong to the <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/team/core-machine-learning">Core Machine Learning</a> team. My research interests lie in the areas of machine learning and optimization. I am based in Bengaluru, India.

I completed my B.Tech in <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/">computer science</a> from <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a> in 2009. After a brief stint as a software engineer at Cisco, I returned to IIT Bombay as a grad student. I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~saketh/">Prof. J. Saketha Nath</a>. I then worked as a postdoctoral researcher with <a href="http://www.ml.uni-saarland.de/people/hein.htm">Prof. Matthias Hein</a> at <a href="http://www.cs.uni-saarland.de/">Saarland University</a>.

<h2>Research  </h2>

    My research interest primarily lies in machine learning and optimization. My doctoral work was focused on developing kernel learning frameworks for learning several problems jointly (a.k.a. multi-task learning). Key ideas include mixed-norm regularizations, saddle-point optimization approaches, and path-following algorithms. An interesting application I worked on was Rule Learning. We modeled this problem as a kernel learning problem. Below are some specific themes I have been working on recently.

  <h4>Research at Amazon </h4>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li> <b>Identifying product safety concerns</b>: We develop algorithms that identify quality defects in products sold at Amazon's platform. The quality defects of interest to me are those that may result in safety concern. </li>
    <li> <b> Identify consumable products</b>: The other problem I am working on is to identify products that are consumables.
  </ul>
  <h3>Research themes</h3>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li> <b>Low-rank optimization with structure</b>:</li>
    <li> <b>Sparse positive semi-definite matrices</b>: We developed a projection-free convex approach for learning sparse positive semi-definite matrices. The proposed algorithm learned (sparse) output kernel for multi-task learning problems very efficiently. It was implemented in the stochastic dual-coordinate ascent framework.</li>
  </ul>
